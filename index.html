      Eloquent objects and arrays exercises
    </h1>
    <h2>The Sum of a range</h2>
    <p>
      1. Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and
      returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and
      including) end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the
      sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does
      indeed return 55.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional
      third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the
      array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one,
      corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2)
      should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step
      values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
    </p>
    <code>
      console.log(range(1, 10)); // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    </code>
    <p></p>
    <code>console.log(range(5, 2, -1)); // → [5, 4, 3, 2] </code>
    <p></p>
    <code>console.log(sum(range(1, 10))); // → 55</code>
    <h2>Reversing an Array</h2>
    <p>
      2. Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the
      order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two
      functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray,
      takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same
      elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what
      the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument by
      reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the
      previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more
      situations? Which one runs faster?
    </p>
    <code>
      console.log(reverseArray(["A", "B", "C"])); // → ["C", "B", "A"];</code
    >
    <p></p>
    <code>let arrayValue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code>
    <p></p>
    <code> reverseArrayInPlace(arrayValue);</code>
    <p></p>
    <code> console.log(arrayValue); // → [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</code>
    <h2>A List</h2>
    <p>
      3. Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of
      data structures. A common data structure is the list (not to be confused
      with array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object
      holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure.
      For example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value:
      -1, rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they
      are both independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up
      their last three elements. The original list is also still a valid
      three-element list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one
      shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a listToArray function
      that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend,
      which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the
      element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a
      number and returns the element at the given position in the list (with
      zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such
      element.
    </p>
    <p>If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of nth.</p>
    <code
      >console.log(arrayToList([10, 20])); // → {value: 10, rest: {value: 20,
      rest: null}}</code
    >
    <p></p>
    <code
      >console.log(listToArray(arrayToList([10, 20, 30]))); // → [10, 20,
      30]</code
    >
    <p></p>
    <code
      >console.log(prepend(10, prepend(20, null))); // → {value: 10, rest:
      {value: 20, rest: null}}</code
    >
    <p></p>
    <code> console.log(nth(arrayToList([10, 20, 30]), 1)); //20 </code>
    <h2>Deep Comparison</h2>
    <p>
      4. The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes you’d
      prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if
      they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the
      values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to
      deepEqual.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the ===
      operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the
      typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a
      deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account:
      because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".
    </p>
    <p>
      The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the
      properties of objects to compare them.
    </p>
    <code
      >let obj = {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2}; console.log(deepEqual(obj,
      obj)); // → true</code
    >
    <p></p>
    <code> console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: 1, object: 2})); // → false</code>
    <p></p>
    <code
      >console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2})); // →
      true</code
