    <h2>The Sum of a range</h2>
    <p>
      1. Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and
      returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and
      including) end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the
      sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does
      indeed return 55.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional
      third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the
      array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one,
      corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2)
      should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step
      values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
